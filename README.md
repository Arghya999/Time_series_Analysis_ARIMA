Time Series Analysis and Modeling with the Air Passengers Dataset
The objective of this analysis and modelling is to review time series theory and experiment with Python packages.

I have followed an ARIMA modeling procedure of the AirPassengers dataset as follows:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis
2. Decomposition of data
3. Test the stationarity
4. Fit a model used an automated algorithm
5. Calculate forecasts for a time period of 10 years.
